problem 1:
Assume s is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that counts up the number of vowels contained in the string s. Valid vowels are: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', 
your program should print:

Number of vowels: 5
For problems such as these, do not include raw_input statements or define the variable s in any way. Our automated testing will provide a value of s for you - so the code
you submit in the following box should assume s is already defined.
If you are confused by this instruction, please review L4 Problems 10 and 11 before you begin this problem set.

Solution :

# Paste your code into this box 
count =0
for key in s:
    if(key in ['a','e','i','o','u']):
        count+=1
print count
