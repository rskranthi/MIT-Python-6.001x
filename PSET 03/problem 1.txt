HANGMAN PART 1: IS THE WORD GUESSED  (5/5 points)
Please read the Hangman Introduction before starting this problem. The helper functions you will be creating in the next three exercises are simply suggestions, but you DO have to implement them if you want to get points for this Hangman Problem Set. If you'd prefer to structure your Hangman program in a different way, feel free to redo this Problem Set in a different way. However, if you're new to programming, or at a loss of how to construct this program, we strongly suggest that you implement the next three helper functions before continuing on to Hangman Part 2.

We'll start by writing 3 simple functions that will help us easily code the Hangman problem. First, implement the function isWordGuessed that takes in two parameters - a string, secretWord, and a list of letters, lettersGuessed. This function returns a boolean - True if secretWord has been guessed (ie, all the letters of secretWord are in lettersGuessed) and False otherwise.

Example Usage:

>>> secretWord = 'apple' 
>>> lettersGuessed = ['e', 'i', 'k', 'p', 'r', 's']
>>> print isWordGuessed(secretWord, lettersGuessed)
False
For this function, you may assume that all the letters in secretWord and lettersGuessed are lowercase.

solution:
def isWordGuessed(secretWord, lettersGuessed):
    '''
    secretWord: string, the word the user is guessing
    lettersGuessed: list, what letters have been guessed so far
    returns: boolean, True if all the letters of secretWord are in lettersGuessed;
      False otherwise
    '''
    ret_val = True
    for i in list(secretWord):
        ret_val = ret_val and (i in lettersGuessed)
    return ret_val
