PROBLEM 6  (10/10 points)
Write a recursive Python function, given a non-negative integer N, to calculate and return the sum of its digits.

Hint: Mod (%) by 10 gives you the rightmost digit (126 % 10 is 6), while doing integer division by 10 removes the rightmost digit (126 / 10 is 12).

This function has to be recursive; you may not use loops!

This function takes in one integer and returns one integer.

def sumDigits(N):
    '''
    N: a non-negative integer
    '''
    # Your code here

solution:
# Paste your function here
def sumDigits(number):
  if number == 0:
    return 0
  else:
    return (number%10) + sumDigits(number//10)
