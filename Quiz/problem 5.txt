PROBLEM 5  (10/10 points)
Write a Python function that returns the sublist of strings in aList that contain fewer than 4 characters. For example, if aList = ["apple", "cat", "dog", "banana"], your function should return: ["cat", "dog"]

This function takes in a list of strings and returns a list of strings. Your function should not modify aList.

def lessThan4(aList):
    '''
    aList: a list of strings
    '''
    # Your code here

solution :
# Paste your function here
def lessThan4(aList):
    # Your code here
    final = []
    for key in aList:
        if(len(key)<4):
            final.append(key)
    return final
