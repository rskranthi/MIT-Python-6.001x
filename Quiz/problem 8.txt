PROBLEM 8  (20/20 points)
Write a Python function called satisfiesF that has the specification below. Then make the function call run_satisfiesF(L, satisfiesF). Your code should look like:

def satisfiesF(L):
    """
    Assumes L is a list of strings
    Assume function f is already defined for you and it maps a string to a Boolean
    Mutates L such that it contains all of the strings, s, originally in L such
            that f(s) returns True, and no other elements
    Returns the length of L after mutation
    """
    # Your function implementation here

run_satisfiesF(L, satisfiesF)
For your own testing of satisfiesF, for example, the following test function f and test code:

def f(s):
    return 'a' in s
      
L = ['a', 'b', 'a']
print satisfiesF(L)
print L
Should print:

2
['a', 'a']
Paste your entire function satisfiesF, including the definition, in the box below. After you define your function, make a function call to run_satisfiesF(L, satisfiesF). Do not define f or run_satisfiesF. Do not leave any debugging print statements.

For this question, you will not be able to see the test cases we run. This problem will test your ability to come up with your own test cases.

solution:

# Paste your function here
def satisfiesF(L):

   count= len(L)
   rec_list=list()

   for i in range(0,count):
     if(f(L[i])==False):
        rec_list.append(L[i])   

   if(rec_list):
     for j in rec_list:
      L.remove(j)
