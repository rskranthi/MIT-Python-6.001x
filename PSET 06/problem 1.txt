PROBLEM 1: ENCRYPTION (BUILDCODER)  (15/15 points)
You'll now write a program to encrypt plaintext into ciphertext using the Caesar cipher.

Be sure you have fully read and understood the introduction to this problem!

solution:

def buildCoder(shift):
    """
    Returns a dict that can apply a Caesar cipher to a letter.
    The cipher is defined by the shift value. Ignores non-letter characters
    like punctuation, numbers, and spaces.

    shift: 0 <= int < 26
    returns: dict
    """
    ### TODO 
    dicton = {}
    low_string = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    high_string = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    new_low_string = low_string[shift:]
    new_low_string = new_low_string + low_string[:shift]
    new_high_string = high_string[shift:]
    new_high_string = new_high_string + high_string[:shift]
    
    for value in high_string:
        dicton[value] = new_high_string[high_string.index(value)]
    for value in low_string:
        dicton[value] = new_low_string[low_string.index(value)]
    return dicton
